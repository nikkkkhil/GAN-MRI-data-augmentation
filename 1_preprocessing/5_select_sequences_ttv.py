# The effects of AD are visible mostly on the middle part of the head, with the lower and upper portions being irrelevant.
# With that in mind, we empirically chose some thresholds and only kept the relevant middle parts (from the ~45 percentile slice to the ~80 percentile slice).
# However, the original volumetric data, and thus the .png data we used, did not have the same dimensions
# i.e. the subjects' heads were not split in the same number of slices, and said slices did not have the same dimensions.
# So, if the visit had 192 slices, only slices 92-140 were kept, etc.
