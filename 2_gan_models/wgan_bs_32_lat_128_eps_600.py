"""An implementation of the improved WGAN described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028

The improved WGAN has a term in the loss function which penalizes the network if its gradient
norm moves away from 1. This is included because the Earth Mover (EM) distance used in WGANs is only easy
to calculate for 1-Lipschitz functions (i.e. functions where the gradient norm has a constant upper bound of 1).

The original WGAN paper enforced this by clipping weights to very small values [-0.01, 0.01]. However, this
drastically reduced network capacity. Penalizing the gradient norm is more natural, but this requires
second-order gradients. These are not supported for some tensorflow ops (particularly MaxPool and AveragePool)
in the current release (1.0.x), but they are supported in the current nightly builds (1.1.0-rc1 and higher).

To avoid this, this model uses strided convolutions instead of Average/Maxpooling for downsampling. If you wish to use
pooling operations in your discriminator, please ensure you update Tensorflow to 1.1.0-rc1 or higher. I haven't
tested this with Theano at all.

The model saves images using pillow. If you don't have pillow, either install it or remove the calls to generate_images.

    GANs, however, the output is linear with no activation function! Instead of being constrained to [0, 1],
    the discriminator wants to make the distance between its output for real and generated samples as large as possible.

    The most natural way to achieve this is to label generated samples -1 and real samples 1, instead of the
    0 and 1 used in normal GANs, so that multiplying the outputs by the labels will give you the loss immediately.

    this function at all points in the input space. The compromise used in the paper is to choose random points
    on the lines between real and generated samples, and check the gradients at these points. Note that it is the
    gradient w.r.t. the input averaged samples, not the weights of the discriminator, that we're penalizing!

    In order to evaluate the gradients, we must first run samples through the generator and evaluate the loss.
    Then we get the gradients of the discriminator w.r.t. the input averaged samples.
    The l2 norm and penalty can then be calculated for this gradient.

    Note that this loss function requires the original averaged samples as input, but Keras only supports passing
    y_true and y_pred to loss functions. To get around this, we make a partial() of the function with the
    averaged_samples argument, and use that for model training."""
